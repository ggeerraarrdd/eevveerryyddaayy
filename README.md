## Description

_eevveerryyddaayy-template_, or simply _eevveerryyddaayy_, is a GitHub template repository. It is the templatized version of [_SQL Everyday_](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/sql-everyday), a personal skill-building challenge that necessitated an automated and streamlined framework to enable consistent daily practice and to manage an ever-growing coding portfolio.

_eevveerryyddaayy_ automates many of the tedious manual work associated with the documentation process, such as handling file creation and organizing project materials. This frees up more time on what matters most—the actual learning.

Note that this repository contains only the documentation for _eevveerryyddaayy_. For the Github template repository itself, go [here](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/eevveerryyddaayy-template/).

_(Everyday, it's a gettin' closer / Goin' faster than a roller coaster / Push like yours will surely come my way, a-hey, a-hey-hey / Push like yours will surely come my way)_

## Target Users

_eevveerryyddaayy_ is intended for **self-directed learners**, such as:

* **Those** committing to consistent technical skill practice.
* **Those** seeking to track their progress for quick reference, knowledge retention and accountability.
* **Those** wanting their record of daily practice organized into an accessible portfolio.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.12**
  * Not tested on other versions
* **VS Code** as your development environment
* Familiarity with **Jupyter Notebooks**
* **Jupyter extension** for VS Code
  * Required for running notebook files
  * **IMPORTANT**: Install specifically version `v2024.11.0` - not tested on any other version
  * From VS Code marketplace: Extensions icon → ⚙️ icon next to Jupyter → Install Another Version → Select v2024.11.0

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* See `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Follow Github's documentation on [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)**

    👉 The template repository is located [here](https://github.com/ggeerraarrdd/eevveerryyddaayy-template/).

2. **Clone the new repository**

    * Open a terminal window in VS Code.
    * Navigate to where you want the repository directory saved.

    ```bash
    git clone your-repository-url
    ```

3. **Set up a Python virtual environment**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Rename VS Code settings file**

    * Navigate to the `.vscode` directory
    * Rename `settings.template.json` to `settings.json`

### Configuration

1. **Default settings**

    **Project Title:**
    * The default title is "[ ] Everyday". **You can choose a different title.**

    **Index Table:**
    * The default index table has 5 columns. **You can add a 6th column.**
    * The default name of an activated sixth column is "NB". **You can choose a different name.**
    * The first column uses sequential numbering as default (e.g. "001", "002"). **You can switch to date format.**

    **Form:**
    * The default Site list in the Form includes: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). **You can add or remove.**

    If you don't want to change these default settings, skip to #4.
  
2. **Customize Project settings**

    You can customize your settings during initialization by using the `every_start.ipynb` notebook.

    1. Open the `every_start.ipynb` notebook in the root directory.
    2. Modify the code cell containing configuration settings:

        ```python
        # Project: Title
        PROJ_TITLE='[ ] Everyday'
        
        # Index Table: Extra Column
        NB=0
        NB_NAME='NB'
        
        # Index Table: Sequential Numbering
        SEQ_NOTATION=0

        # Index Table: Sequential Gaps
        SEQ_SPARSE=0
        
        # Form: Site Options
        SITE_OPTIONS=['Codewars', 'DataLemur', 'LeetCode']
        ```

3. **Configuration options explained**

    **Project Title:**
    * Change `PROJ_TITLE` to your preferred project title.

    **Index Table:**
    * To add a 6th column: `NB=1`
    * To customize the 6th column name: `NB_NAME='Your Preferred Name'`
    * To switch to date format instead of sequential numbering: `SEQ_NOTATION=1`
    * To allow gaps in sequential numbering: `SEQ_SPARSE=1`

    **Form:**
    * Customize `SITE_OPTIONS` with your preferred sites as a list of strings.
    * If there is only one item in the list, that site becomes the only option and default value.

4. **Customize README**

    ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The Index table, including its enclosing markdown comments, can be placed elsewhere but must not be modified in any other way or deleted.

    Feel free to make any other changes to README, including the title and description of your project.

## Usage

1. Open the project folder on VS Code, if not already.

2. Open `every_entry.ipynb` in the root directory.

3. Execute the cell containing the python code or `Run All` to display the form interface.

4. Fill in the fields and click the submit button.

    🎉 Congratulations! You're a day closer to achieving your goal!

## System Administration

### **Configuration Updates**

⚠️ **Note:** Configuration updates after initialization will be supported in a future version.

If you need to modify your project settings after initialization:

* The upcoming feature will support configuration updates through `every_update.ipynb`.
* This will allow you to change project settings without starting from scratch.
* Currently, some settings like Index Table structure can only be set during initialization.
