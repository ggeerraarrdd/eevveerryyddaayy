Utility Functions Module

This module provides a collection of utility functions and components to support 
core application operations. It exports constants, data management tools, and helper 
functions that handle various aspects of application workflow.

Components
----------
Constants:
    HYPHEN, INDEX_START, INDEX_END, FIRST_ROW, SECOND_ROW: 
        String constants used throughout the application for formatting and parsing

Classes:
    PackageManager:
        Handles dictionary-based data storage and manipulation for form inputs and derived values

Functions:
    clean_strings:
        Normalizes and sanitizes string inputs
    get_files_created:
        Generates solution files from template
    get_target_line_dict:
        Converts string to dictionary for downstream processing
    get_target_line_updated:
        Functions for locating and updating specific lines in Index table in README.md
    validate_project:
        Checks whether the project has been properly initialized

These utilities form the foundation for higher-level operations handled by the application's
main modules and handlers.
